Day 6 - Sets
----

The task today involves passengers (1 per line) in groups (separated by blank lines), who have answered questions a-z.

Part 1 task is to find, per group, all the questions answered by *any* member of that group. i.e. a union of sets, or just the set of the whole group.

The second part clarifies that it should be questions answered by *all* members of a group. This is an intersection of sets.
