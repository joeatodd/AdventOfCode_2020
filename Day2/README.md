Day 2 - Valid Password Identification
----

String parsing in C++ seems like it's a lot easier than it would be in C...

These are pretty rubbish password settings!

Part 1 requires that a given letter be specified at least N times and at most M times.

Part 2 interprets N and M to be positions, and requires that exactly one of those positions contain the specified letter.

Could I have achieved this using regex? Probably, but I'm not sure it would be any more efficient/robust, and this way I am learning more about C++ basics.
